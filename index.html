            <p>This website is designed to learn a bit more about me and some of my experiences! What 
                better way to show off some of my work than by designing my first webpage using HTML and CSS. 
            </p>
            <p>Select either About or Projects below to learn about my background or projects that I have worked on recently.</p> 
            <p><i>I intend to update this site going forward to better reflect my experiences and further develop my 
                knowledge of HTML and CSS. It could even be a good starting point to learn some Javascript.</i>
