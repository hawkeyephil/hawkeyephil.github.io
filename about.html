        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Philip Caldarella. I currently reside in the North Haven, CT. 
            I am a junior at Quinnipiac University studying Economics and Computer Science. I was first
            exposed to CS when I attended North Haven High School. I discovered a foundness for it and 
            decided to pursue it in college. At Quinnipiac, I developed a passion for economics and committed
            to achieve degrees in both fields.
